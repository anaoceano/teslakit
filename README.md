# TESLA-KIT 

Teslakit is a Python3 library for statistical calculations and methodologies for handling global climate data.
The stochastic climate emulator proposed is built on the recognition that coastal conditions are the result of meteorological forcing, 
and that synoptic-scale meteorology is in turn a consequence of large-scale quasi-steady atmospheric and oceanic patterns (e.g., Hannachi & Legras, 1995)

## Install 
- - -

Source code is currently hosted on Bitbucket at: https://gitlab.com/ripollcab/teslakit/tree/master 

### Installing from sources

Navigate to the base root of [teslakit](./)

Using a Python virtual environment is recommended

```
# install virtualenv packageÂ 
python3 -m pip install virtualenv

# create a new virtual environment for teslakit installation
python3 -m virtualenv venv

# now activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now install teslakit requirements

```
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

Then install teslakit

```
python setup.py install
```

### Installing aditional modules

mw\_deltares is a custom developed python toolbox used to wrap SWAN numerical model

install the python wheel file that is included at resources folder

```
pip install requirements/mw_deltares-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Installing optional modules

Basemap module is used in some Teslakit figures.

It is not needed to run any calculation and installing it is optional

Follow Basemap installation instructions at https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap


## Handling a Teslakit Project 
- - -

Jupyter notebook files can be found at [notebooks](notebooks/)

launch jupyter notebook

```
jupyter notebook
```

Current development test site notebooks can be found at [ROI](notebooks/nb_ROI/)

Also, test site needed input files can be downloaded from [OneDrive](https://unican-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ripolln_unican_es/EbV8pLPheXZEpg8I6VCKjF4BscJoReoq5pO5w0358x88Vg?e=ygozCh)

(Input data adquisition is currently not integrated in teslakit)


Once ROI data is downloaded and unpacked, a input data check can be done at: [00_Set_Database.ipynb](notebooks/ROI/01_Offshore/00_Set_Database.ipynb)
